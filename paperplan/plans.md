## Project Vision

**Paper UI** is a React component library built around natural materials: textured paper, ink, canvas, wood grain, and watercolor washes. It is a standalone NPM package (`@dendelion/paper-ui`) that serves as the visual foundation for Paper Camp and any other project needing an organic, tactile UI.

### Core Concept

- **Paper** — warm off-white backgrounds with subtle grain texture
- **Ink** — deep charcoal with slightly irregular, hand-drawn edges
- **Canvas** — cream-colored surfaces with visible weave texture
- **Watercolor** — soft blended washes for accents and hover states

### Architecture
